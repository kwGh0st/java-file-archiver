# Java ZIP File Operations using JavaFX

This program facilitates operations on .zip files and utilizes the JavaFX library for its user interface. The UI was visually designed using SceneBuilder, an application for creating JavaFX layouts. Additionally, the project is managed and built using Gradle, a powerful build automation tool for Java projects.

## Overview

The archiver application allows users to perform various operations on .zip files, including creating new archives, adding and removing files from existing archives, extracting the contents of archives, and displaying the archive's contents.

## Features

- Utilizes JavaFX for a visually appealing user interface.
- Supports operations such as creating a new .zip file.
- Adding and removing files to/from an existing archive.
- Extraction of files from the archive.
- Displaying the contents of the archive.
   
## Dependencies and Building

The project utilizes Gradle for dependency management, compiling, and building Java projects. Ensure Gradle is installed to manage the project's dependencies and build process.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structure that separates the UI design created using SceneBuilder, the Java code implementing the archive operations, and Gradle configurations for managing the project.

## Planned Enhancements

Future enhancements may include:
- Improved user interface design and functionality.
- Addition of more advanced archive operations.
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback.
